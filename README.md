# SQLPortfolioProjects

In this project, I utilized Microsoft SQL to explore Covid Deaths and Vaccination rates around the world between January 2020 to April 2021. 

I practiced SQL basics, including Join, CTE, Tables, and Views.

The data utilized in this project was obtained from ourworldindata.org
